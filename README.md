# Soundscape project
R code for 'Not silent, yet: the shifting sounds of spring'

R code for soundscape construction:

1 - Soundscape construction.R
    
    R code to construct soundscapes and generate acoustic metrics.

R code for statistical analysis: 

1 - Response to acoustic metrics to changes in community structure.R

    R code to run GLMs of variation in acoustic metrics of simulated communities in relation to the 
    number of individuals and the number of species. 
    
    Associated datafiles: COMMUNITY_EU, COMMUNITY_US - ADD LINK TO DRYAD
    
2 - Site-level changes in acoustic metrics.R

    R code to run large-scale GLMMs of geographical and annual variation in acoustic metrics and GLMs 
    of site-level trends.
    
    Associated datafiles: metricsEuropemeans.csv, metricsUSmeans.csv - ADD LINK TO DRYAD

3 - Site-level changes in total number of individuals and species.R
    
    R code to run large-scale GLMMs of geographical and annual variation in the total number of 
    indiviudals and species and GLMs of site-level trends.
